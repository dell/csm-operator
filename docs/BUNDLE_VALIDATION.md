## Bundle Validation Guide

To ensure your Operator bundle meets Operator Framework standards and passes all required checks, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Operator SDK installed (See https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/)
- A valid Operator bundle directory (typically `./bundle/`)

### Basic Validation

Run the following command to validate your bundle:

```bash
operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle
```

### Optional Suite Validation

To run additional optional checks provided by the Operator Framework, use the `--select-optional` flag:

```bash
operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle --select-optional suite=operatorframework
```

### Notes

- If you encounter deprecation warnings (e.g., related to `go/v3` layout), check your `PROJECT` file and ensure it uses the correct layout version (e.g., `go.kubebuilder.io/v4`).
- The bundle validation process does **not** require a running Kubernetes cluster.
- Optional checks (enabled via `--select-optional`) are not mandatory but are highly recommended for improving the quality and compliance of your Operator.
